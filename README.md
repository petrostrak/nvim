## nvim
My neovim setup for golang and rust development

```
brew install neovim
```

To full utilize nvim-telescope, the ripgre binary is needed
```
brew install ripgrep
```

In case nvim is missing from the python3 directories
```
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pynvim
```

To install new plugins in nvim

* `:w` 
* `:luafile %` 
* `:PackerInstall`
